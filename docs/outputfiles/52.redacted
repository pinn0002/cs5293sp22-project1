███████,

Thank you for using Alamo.com to make your car rental reservation.

Your Confirmation Number is: 6070346

You will need this number to pick up your car, make any changes to, or cancel your reservation.
Please print this e-mail message or record confirmation number to pick up your rental.

Here's what you do to pickup your car:

?Open from 7 a.m. to

    the Alamo bus at Ground Transportation.

  ?It will take you to
    our rental facility which is open 24 hours a day.

  ?All rentals are picked
    up and dropped off there, so shuttle service is required. Local renters go

    the airport terminal.

  ?The train station is
    located about 20 minutes from the airport.
